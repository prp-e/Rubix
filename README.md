#Rubix Operating System

After checking [Perl/Linux](http://perllinux.sourceforge.net/), I've decided to
make an alternative in Ruby. But, Rubix is very different, because I didn't re-write
any programs, I've just write necessary programs for a Ruby-based User-space.

## Tested operating systems 

1. Ubuntu (Linux)
2. Arch Linux (Linux)
3. FreeBSD (BSD)
4. [JabirOS](http://jabirproject.org) (BSD)
